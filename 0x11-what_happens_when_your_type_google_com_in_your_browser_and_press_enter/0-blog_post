When you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter, a series of events are set in motion that eventually lead to the display of the Google homepage. These events involve several important components of the internet, including DNS servers, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load-balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases. Here's an overview of what happens at each step:

DNS request: The first thing that happens when you type the URL into your browser is a request to the DNS (Domain Name System) server. The DNS server is responsible for translating the human-readable domain name (e.g., "google.com") into an IP address (e.g., 216.58.194.174) that computers can understand.

TCP/IP: After the IP address has been obtained, your browser uses the TCP/IP protocol to establish a connection with the Google web server. TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, and it's the standard communication protocol used on the internet.

Firewall: As your browser makes its request, it may have to pass through one or more firewalls. Firewalls are security devices that help protect against unauthorized access to a network. They control the incoming and outgoing traffic based on rules set by the network administrator.

HTTPS/SSL: Once the connection is established, the browser and web server use the HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) protocol to communicate. HTTPS encrypts the data transmitted between the browser and the web server, helping to protect sensitive information from being intercepted by malicious actors.

Load-balancer: When you request a web page from a popular site like Google, the request is often handled by multiple servers, which are managed by a load-balancer. The load-balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, helping to ensure that the site remains fast and responsive even during periods of high traffic.

Web server: The web server receives the request from the browser, processes it, and returns the appropriate data. In the case of Google, this typically means returning the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the Google homepage.

Application server: Some web pages, especially those that include dynamic content (e.g., search results), require additional processing. This is often done by an application server, which may retrieve data from a database, perform calculations, and generate the final output that is sent back to the web server.

Database: Finally, the application server may retrieve data from one or more databases, depending on the information required to generate the final output. For example, Google's search results are generated by retrieving information from its vast database of web pages, images, and other content.

In summary, when you type https://www.google.com into your browser and press Enter, a complex series of events is set in motion, involving multiple components of the internet working together to bring you the information you requested. From the DNS request to the final display of the Google homepage, each step is critical to ensuring that your experience is fast, secure, and accurate.
